# Advent of Code 2017

http://adventofcode.com

"Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme."

## Personal Goals

This year I'm attempting AOC in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/). Even if it fries my brain ;)

## Running the Code

To run the project, you will need to clone this project and [install Boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot#install).

Once Boot is setup, launch the REPL in your terminal of choice and pass in any day namespace to act on it's functions.

```
#> boot repl
```

```clojure
(require 'day1)
(day1/part-1)
```

## Feedback Welcome!

If I'm doing something wrong, crazy, stupid or all of the above, feel free to yell at me until I get it right. Seriously though, I'm here to learn. Critiques (or questions) welcome!
